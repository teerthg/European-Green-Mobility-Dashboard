European Green Mobility Dashboard
CO₂ Emissions Analysis – Power BI 2025
Project Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of CO₂ emissions from newly registered passenger cars across Europe. It highlights emission patterns by manufacturer, fuel type, and vehicle characteristics such as engine capacity, engine power, and vehicle mass.

The entire dashboard was developed in Power BI, with a focus on clear visual storytelling, data-driven insights, and statistical reasoning to support sustainable mobility efforts across the European Union.

Dataset Information

The data originates from the European Union Regulation (EU) 2019/631, which requires CO₂ reporting for all new passenger car registrations.

Dataset Size: ~4.9 million records
Source: EU Open Data Portal

Main Variables

Variable	Description
Manufacturer	Car manufacturer
Fuel Type	Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid, etc.
Engine Capacity (cm³)	Volume of engine
Power (kW)	Engine power
Vehicle Mass (kg)	Weight of the vehicle
CO₂ Emissions (g/km)	Emissions per kilometer
Analytical Approach
1. Data Preparation

Cleaned and standardized data using Power Query

Removed duplicates and handled missing values

Ensured consistent formatting for numeric and categorical fields

2. Descriptive Statistics

Used DAX to compute averages, standard deviations, and distributions

Summarized key emission indicators

3. KPIs

Average CO₂ Emission: 114.28 g/km

Average Engine Capacity: 1.50K cm³

Average Power: 93.45 kW

4. Comparative Analysis

Compared emissions across manufacturers

Evaluated emission differences by fuel type

5. Correlation Study

Analyzed the relationship between engine capacity, mass, and CO₂ emissions

Identified a strong positive correlation between engine size and emissions

Dashboard Components
Component	Purpose
KPI Cards	Display overall averages
Bar Chart	Compare manufacturers based on emission levels
Pie Chart	Show fuel type distribution
Scatter Plot	Visualize the correlation between engine capacity and emissions
Filters	Interactive slicers for manufacturer, country, and fuel type
Key Findings

Fuel Type Trends
Petrol and diesel cars dominate the dataset, accounting for more than 95% of registrations. Adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles remains low.

Emission Correlation
Vehicles with higher engine capacity consistently show higher CO₂ emissions.

Manufacturer Differences
Premium manufacturers such as BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche show significantly higher average emissions compared to economy and electric-focused brands.

Environmental Performance
Electric vehicles show the lowest emissions, aligning with EU sustainability objectives.

Results Summary

Average CO₂ Emission: 114.28 g/km

Average Engine Capacity: 1.50K cm³

Average Power: 93.45 kW

Electric + Hybrid Share: < 5%

Correlation between engine capacity and emissions: r ≈ 0.78

Project Impact

The dashboard provides a clear analytical framework that can help policymakers, environmental researchers, and automotive companies:

Identify high-emission vehicle categories

Monitor progress toward EU CO₂ reduction goals

Support decision-making for sustainable mobility initiatives

It demonstrates how visual analytics and statistical reasoning can contribute toward climate-conscious strategies in the automotive sector.
